Hello Professor Bistriceanu

1. I created a java file for part 1 of the project 
2. To start I used a scanner to scan the user input for the string 
3. Any character that is not 0-9 was removed and that number was printed 
4. I then used the contains method to check if the unlock access code "419061" is in the number or the lock access code "419064"
5. The program is to then tell you what action has been taken unlock or lock 
6. I then created a separate java file for part 2 of the project
7. To estimate the average time to break the lock I set the input string to be 100 digits, the number of attempts to 100000, and used a counter to find the total number of successful attempts 
8. I used a for loop and a random number generator, which is a string, to simulate many attempts
9. The contains method was used again to check if unlock access code was found 
10. To find the average of successful attempts I took the total number of successful attempts and divided it by the number of attempts  
11. I then conducted an actual test 
12. I made another random number generator that was a string 
13. I again used contains to check when the lock was unlocked 
14. I used the split method to see how many times the lock was unlocked 
15. I then used the substring method to find out how many symbols were generated until the lock was unlocked 
16. In case the lock was not unlocked the program prompts you to try again

The FA was all made in the java language 

The regular expressions in Java are patterns of characters that describe a set of strings. The java.util.regex package is used to find patterns in an input sequence. 

The FA can go:
Lock 
Unlock 
Lock & Unlock
Unlock & Lock
